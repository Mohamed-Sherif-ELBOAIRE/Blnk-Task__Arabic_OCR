**Project Overview:**

This GitHub repository showcases a technical project that demonstrates my skills as a Machine Learning Engineer, particularly in the field of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The project was developed with the intent of applying for a position at Blnk Company, where I dedicated significant effort and expertise to tackle the challenges associated with Arabic text OCR.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Libraries Installments:**
- To run the projects, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
  Python 3.x
  Sklearn
  NumPy
  Matplotlib
  tensorflow
  tensorboard
  os
  datatime
  
- **OCR for Arabic Text:** This project addresses the complexities of recognizing Arabic text, offering insights into the Arabic script in OCR tasks.

- **Dual Datasets:** The project handles two distinct datasets, one containing blurred images and the other comprising sharpened images. The focus, however, is primarily on sharpened images to align with the core objective.

- **CTC Loss and Encoding/Decoding:** The project delves into the utilization of Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and its encoding/decoding techniques, a fundamental aspect of OCR.

- **Image Enhancement:** Techniques for enhancing image quality,grayscaling and thresholding , are explored to ensure optimal OCR performance.

- **Model Architecture:** The heart of the OCR model is a fusion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, backed by a robust CTC loss layer.

- **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained and evaluated, with a focus on monitoring key metrics such as training and validation loss

**Conclusion and Future Improvements:**

This project serves as a testament to my dedication, perseverance, and technical proficiency as a Machine Learning Engineer. It highlights my ability to tackle complex problems and build robust models, even under computational constraints. While the project has achieved significant milestones, there is immense potential for further enhancements, particularly with additional computational resources and advanced image enhancement and segmentation techniques.
